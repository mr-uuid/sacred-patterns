# Approach

## Development
How do I push to GitHub, code commit, and bitbucket at the same time?
- [How to push to multiple git remotes at once](https://gist.github.com/rvl/c3f156e117e22a25f242)

- Should I make the site a react app?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Leveraging Databases
- How do I leverage databases for this?!

### Future Iteration
- [ ] These operations are very interesting: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-geometry.html
	- [ ] Can I have an in-memory postures database to contain and query all of the shapes we want to paint?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deployment
- How will the site be deployed?

### Hosting
- Where will it be hosted?
- What is the cheapest way to host a site?
	* [ ] https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/

- [ ] Should this be a separate site / gh-pages site? 
- [-] Should it be under awefullcode.com?
	It is awe-full as well ... ???
- [ ] Should it be under composing-meta4s.com/sacred-patterns

## What is the deployment process / pipeline?
* [ ] Setup a multi-step pipeline … with a DAG …
	* [ ] Create a PlantUML diagram showcasing the intended build process!
		* [ ] I need to make sure I can push to dockerhub too …
	* [ ] [Tinker with Build Pipelines](ia-writer://open?path=/Locations/personalbook/roles/The%20Experimenter/Tinkering%20with%20Tech/Tinker%20with%20Build%20Pipelines.txt)
	* [ ] Do I really need a build server initially?
		* [ ] Can I showcase a post commit hook …

- For site ...
	- Need build system ...
		- Should I do jenkins?
		- Use aws?
		- Travis/github actions?

- Hack ... can I get docker hub / GitHub in a recursive loop to deploy a site during build?

- [ ] Make a build server to build this?!
  - [ ] Tie website builds to github releases ...

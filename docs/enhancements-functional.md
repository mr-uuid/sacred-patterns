# Funtional Enhancements
- How can I enhance the primary drawing experience?

# Determining Intersection
* [ ] How can I identify intersection with d3 …?
- [ ] Can we determine hexagon intersection / get the intersected polygons … based on iterating on their lines and determining line intersection?
- [ ] Can I so semicircles and determine semicircle intersection programmatically??
- [ ] Show how tips of star can be colored !
- [ ] Show how whitespace / intersections can be selected and colored!
* [ ] Have an iteration where I break down some of the patterns ... i.e drawings that teach people the patterns!
  * [ ] I.e This Pattern Plus this Other Pattern Rotated … Equals this!

# Determining bounding boxes / fitting ..
- Sacred patterns ... draw a shape ... if it fits ...
	- Log when its not drawn ...
	- is the bounding box of the shape within the bonding canvas ?

# Rotating Stuff ...
* [ ] Implement Rotating a circle …
  * [ ] Anything inside the circle … like a hexing … should also rotate …

# Grid Lines
- [ ] Draw grid lines with the recursive circles ...

# Maybe
* [ ] Make command like: center on edges of octagon vertical hexagon …?

- [ ] Add the following methods
    - [ ] Make Polar Slices Method
    - [ ] Make Verticle Slices Method
    - [ ] Make Horizontal Slices Method
    - [ ] Connect Midpoints of two different circles ...
    - [ ] connect points into lines ...
    - [ ] Octagon within circle ...

- [ ] Make a lines class ...
    - [ ] Extend Line ...

- [ ] Add a "grid" class that knowns what elements "contain" other elements ... and what elemets "surround other elements"

# Interleaving Patterns
* [ ] Liked how to islamic pattern can interleave by getting one pattern to be the background of the other

# DSL
Can I have a config file that, based on it, things get drawn ...?

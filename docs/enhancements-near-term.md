# How will I enhance the capabilities of the code?


# Improve Performance …
- [ ] Improve the Recursion …
- [ ] Leverage the GPU?
  - [ ] Check out [Enabling high-performance Metal rendering with drawingGroup()](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/enabling-high-performance-metal-rendering-with-drawinggroup)

# Turn it into an app!
- [ ] Look into making some of the basic patterns as an iphone app in swift
    - [ ] Tinker with this: [How to create Activity Ring in SwiftUI | Sarun](https://sarunw.com/posts/how-to-create-activity-ring-in-swiftui/)

# Turn it into a site ... with a story ...
- [x] Start curating a folder of the patterns I want to implement … and I have implemented …
    - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7pvi6pcwbrgxda3/AADn0p8lTqNIZ1ezAMgU9M22a?dl=0
- [ ] Serve these on my site as compare and contrast …
- [ ] Can I show my iterations through a timeline?
	* [ ] The w3 javascript page I went to had a whole bunch of examples with timelines!
* [ ] Have an iteration where I index all of the drawing of all of the other iterations … into a timeline … or slideshow …
* [ ] For the tessellation, I eventually need to show that it is programatic knowledge - vary size or something
  * [ ] d3 simple circle example … https://bl.ocks.org/ocarneiro/41a7c039d95ccdf2c7d2b2d2474d52f9

# Determining Intersection
* [ ] How can I identify intersection with d3 …?
- [ ] Can we determine hexagon intersection / get the intersected polygons … based on iterating on their lines and determining line intersection?
- [ ] Can I so semicircles and determine semicircle intersection programmatically??
- [ ] Show how tips of star can be colored !
- [ ] Show how whitespace / intersections can be selected and colored!
* [ ] Have an iteration where I break down some of the patterns ... i.e drawings that teach people the patterns!
  * [ ] I.e This Pattern Plus this Other Pattern Rotated … Equals this!

# Debugging
- When I hover over a shape ... show how many shapes this intersects with ...
	- (How can I tell if a point is inside ... our outside a shape ...

# Determining bounding boxes / fitting ..
- Sacred patterns ... draw a shape ... if it fits ...
	- Log when its not drawn ...
	- is the bounding box of the shape within the bonding canvas ?

# Rotate Stuff ...
* [ ] Implement Rotating a circle …
  * [ ] Anything inside the circle … like a hexing … should also rotate …

# Grid Lines
- [ ] Draw grid lines with the recursive circles ...

# Spiritual ...
* [ ] Have deep pattern … that says … even though you can not see the center … does it exist?!

# Maybe
* [ ] Make command like: center on edges of octagon vertical hexagon …?
